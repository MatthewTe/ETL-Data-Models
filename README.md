# ETL Data Models
This repository is a collection of various data models that I have written for use in other data pipelines and database normalization processes. These data models span a wide range of applications and are refrenced in many of my other ETL projects. I have simply aggregated them here for convenience.

The main purpose of this repository is for me to document the processes of each data model and how they were integrated into my data pipelines as a way of ensuring that I am able to return to and maintain my pipelines
